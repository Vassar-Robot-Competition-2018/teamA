# Week 1 Notebook

This week we discussed our thoughts for general strategies.
  * What are the most important things the robot should be doing?
    * Following the wall?
  * Heirarchy of control
  * Focus on our blocks first
  * Efficiency and simplicity vs elaborate design

Designing the form of the robot
  * Two wheels on front, one loose wheel on the back.
  * Don't want to use grabbing mechanism. Funnelling instead

ballistic vs reactive programming: we will use combination depending on
situation
