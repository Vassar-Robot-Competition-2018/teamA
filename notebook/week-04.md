# Week 4 Notebook

This week, we installed several new components including the pixy camera, light sensors, and a new flap. We are working towards milestone 3 and 4 for next week. 

## Installed Light Sensors
Eliana and Gabe installed light sensors on the bottom of the fixtures which hold the wheel servos. They point towards the ground and we are using them in order to detect tape in the arena. George worked on code that would stop and back the robot up when these sensors detect the reflective tape. It took some trial and error to pinpoint the difference in sensitivity between the two sensors.  

## Completion of Milestone 2 
After we installed the new light sensors and completed the software to interface and respond to their readings, we completed milestone 2. 

## Installed Pixy Camera
Gabe and Eliana installed the Pixy cam at the front of our robot using screws and tape. Gabe came in Friday afternoon and worked on code that would allow the robot to stop or go depending on whether or not any blocks were in the camera's view. George had also been working on code to interface and repsond to the camera in class on Tuesday.

## Front Flap
Gabe installed a flap which can fold down at the front of the robot using lego components and foamboard. Eventually, we will connect this component to a servo so that we can control it in software. We are still in the process of figuring out a way to do this, but are thinking we may weight it and connect it to a servo using string.
