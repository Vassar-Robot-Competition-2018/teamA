# Week 3 Notebook

## Flappy McDoodle v2
Instead of having just one funnel, we want to have a channel that lets the bad ones fall through, and then a good chamber. The default will be the bad chamber, and then we will have a pivot mechanism hooked up to a servo to change the direction of the block to go into the good chamber. 

## Tuesday
George is working on some circuitry and coding. Eliana and Gabe working on FDv2.

## Road to Milestone 1
On Monday George worked on completing milestone 1. There were some issues with the servos on the Arduino not responding to the rotation angles of 180 and 0 (nor 170 and 10), but finally worked with 150 and 30.

## Photos
We've taken some photos of our robot which you can find in the notebook folder. All the files are given names week-3-n.jpg

## More Milestones
We are currently stopping focusing on our flap mechanism in order to focus on the milestones so we can complete them by spring break.

## Acknowledgments
On Monday, George got the code written to complete milestone 1. Last week Eliana and Gabe made progress on creating a prototype of the flap.
