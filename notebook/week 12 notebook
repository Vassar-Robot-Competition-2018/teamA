WEEK 12 NOTEBOOK

NEW CHANGES
We added a light for the home quadrant, current quadrant, and block color, so each lightâ€™s up respectively. 
We drilled down everything on the top of the robot so that if we need to flip it over and use the stand,
nothing will fall off. We also reprinted the spinning door so that it is more of a wall on the side that 
lets the blocks out, so that the blocks would be less likely to get stuck and drag as the robot moves. 
We will consider increasing the angle of the funnel to reduce the risk of the blocks getting stuck even further. 
There is currently no camera being used, but we could add the camera back if we want to. We should be able to do 
without it and use random turning to find blocks of our home color, and if time permits the camera can be used 
to seek and drive towards block of our home color that it sees. If we have the camera, we may need to swerve 
back and forth while driving to look for blocks.

FINAL CODING
The have implemented the coding logic to drive back to the home quadrant after 3:00 minutes of running in 
the arena, avoiding the home quadrant until then. When the robot is searching for blocks, it stays out of 
its home quadrant entirely until the 3 minutes are up. The code has also been adjusted to account for some 
of the edge cases we have been seeing. If the door mechanism opens for a block, there is a 750 delay, but 
when the robot is close to the white line edge the delay causes the robot not to sense that it is out of bounds. 
To prevent the robot from running outside the arena when this case occurs, we maybe need to change it to a state 
based, or just make it as minimal of a delay as possible. We also have decided not to implement the code that we
keep track of the amount of blocks captured so we can return home at the end, and return based purely on timing without the camera.
