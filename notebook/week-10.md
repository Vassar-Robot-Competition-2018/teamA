# Week 10

This week we focused on finishing up models for our robot and getting our sorting mechanism printed. We re-printed mounts for the wheels with corrected orientation and color sensor slots.

## Wheel Mounts
The wheel mounts print a lot of support material inside the sensor mounting slots. One way that we considered to prevent this from happening is printing the slot separately and then gluing it onto the bottom of the mount. 

## New Body
We are building a new body in order to test our sorting mechanism. This body will be built in foam core and shaped similarly to our initial body. We debated 2 different ideas for our tunnel. The first idea we had was to build a straight tunnel. The straight tunnel will be simple to build, but there may be issues with driving/turning if they are all in a single straight line. The straight tunnel would also force our body to be long, the length of 4 blocks plus our sorting mechanism and the funnel.

With a curved tunnel we can decrease the size of our body, but we're less sure of how well we'll be able to pull blocks. Since the blocks aren't in a straight line the friction of the block and the mat may be decreased since the blocks are not in a single line, but it also may be increased because the blocks are spread more horizontally.
